# Introduction

Since the adoption of [@P0784R7] in C++20, constant expressions can include
dynamic memory allocation; yet support for smart pointers extends only to
`std::unique_ptr` (since [@P2273R3] in C++23). As at runtime, smart pointers
can encourage hygienic memory management during constant evaluation; and with
no remaining technical obstacles, parity between runtime and compile-time
support for smart pointers should duly and intuitively reflect the increased
maturity of language support for constant expression evaluation.  We therefore
propose that `std::shared_ptr` and associated class templates from
[smartptr]{.sref} permit `constexpr`{.cpp} evaluation.

# Motivation and Scope

Two proposals adopted for C++26 and C++23 can facilitate a straightforward
implementation of comprehensive `constexpr`{.cpp} support for
`std::shared_ptr`: [@P2738R1] and [@P2448R2]. The former allows the
`get_deleter` member function to operate, given the type erasure required
within the `std::shared_ptr` unary class template. The latter can allow even
minor associated classes such as `std::bad_weak_ptr` to receive
`constexpr`{.cpp} qualification, while inheriting from the currently
non-`constexpr`{.cpp} class: `std::exception`. We furthermore propose that the
relational operators of `std::unique_ptr`, which can legally operate on
pointers originating from a single allocation during constant evaluation,
should also adopt the `constexpr`{.cpp} specifier.

As with C++23 `constexpr`{.cpp} support for `std::unique_ptr`, bumping the
value `__cpp_lib_constexpr_memory` is our requested feature macro change; yet
in the discussion and implementation presented here, we adopt the macro
`__cpp_lib_constexpr_shared_ptr`. We also use the `_GLIBCXX26_CONSTEXPR` macro
in place of the literal `constexpr`{.cpp} keyword to ensure the specifier only
applies when the `-std=c++26` flag is enabled.

We below elaborate on points which go beyond the simple addition of the
`constexpr`{.cpp} specifier to the relevant member functions.

## Atomic Operations

`std::shared_ptr` can operate within a multithreaded runtime environment; and a
number of its member functions use atomic functions to ensure that shared state
is updated correctly. Constant expressions must currently be evaluated by a
single thread. A `constexpr`{.cpp} `std::shared_ptr` implementation can engage
with the `constexpr`{.cpp}-friendly support for single-threaded evaluation
available in atomic function definitions within standard library
implementations. For example, in libstdc++'s interface to atomic functions, the
`__is_single_threaded` function, which controls execution of both
`__exchange_and_add_dispatch` and `__atomic_add_dispatch` within the
`ext/atomicity.h` header file, can be changed to start as follows:

```cpp
_GLIBCXX26_CONSTEXPR
__attribute__((__always_inline__))
inline bool
__is_single_threaded() _GLIBCXX_NOTHROW
{
#ifdef __cpp_lib_constexpr_shared_ptr
  if (std::is_constant_evaluated())
    return true;
#endif
  // ... 7 more lines here
}
```

Built-in GCC atomic functions such as `__atomic_load_n` are also used within
libstdc++'s implementation of `std::shared_ptr`. These could similarly be
updated to account for a `constexpr`{.cpp} single-threaded execution
environment within the compiler. The approach taken within our own
implementation is a local one; eliding the call to the atomic function through
the predication of `std::is_constant_evaluated` (or `if consteval`). For
example, here is an updated function from `bits/shared_ptr_base.h`, used by
`std::shared_ptr::use_count()` and elsewhere:

```cpp
_GLIBCXX26_CONSTEXPR
long
_M_get_use_count() const noexcept
{
#ifdef __cpp_lib_constexpr_shared_ptr
  return std::is_constant_evaluated()
           ? _M_use_count
           : __atomic_load_n(&_M_use_count, __ATOMIC_RELAXED);
#else
  return __atomic_load_n(&_M_use_count, __ATOMIC_RELAXED);
#endif
}
```
## Two Memory Allocations

Unlike `std::unique_ptr`, a `std::shared_ptr` must store not only the managed
object, but also the type-erased deleter and allocator, as well as the number
of `std::shared_ptr`s and `std::weak_ptr`s which own or refer to the managed
object. This information is managed as part of a dynamically allocated object
referred to as the *control block*.

Existing runtime implementations of `make_shared`, `allocate_shared`,
`make_shared_for_overwrite`, and `allocate_shared_for_overwrite`, allocate
memory for both the control block, *and* the managed object, from a single
dynamic memory allocation; via `reinterpret_cast`{.cpp}.  This practise aligns
with a remark at [util.smartptr.shared.create]{.sref}; quoted below:

  - [7.1]{.pnum} Implementations should perform no more than one memory allocation.
  - [*Note 1*: This provides efficiency equivalent to an intrusive smart pointer.  â€” *end note*]

As `reinterpret_cast`{.cpp} is not permitted within a constant expression, an
alternative approach is required for `make_shared`, `allocate_shared`,
`make_shared_for_overwrite`, and `allocate_shared_for_overwrite`.  A
straightforward solution is to create the object first, and pass its address to
the appropriate `std::shared_ptr` constructor. Considering the control block,
this approach amounts to two dynamic memory allocations; albeit at
compile-time. Assuming that the runtime implementation need not change, the
remark quoted above could either be removed, or changed to "Implementations
should perform no more than one runtime memory allocation."

## Relational Operators

Comparing dynamically allocated pointers within a constant expression is legal,
provided the result of the comparison is not unspecified.  Such comparisons are
defined in terms of a partial order, applicable to pointers which either point
"to different elements of the same array, or to subobjects thereof"; or to
"different non-static data members of the same object, or to subobjects of such
members, recursively..."; from paragraph 4 of [expr.rel]{.sref}. A simple
example program is shown below:

```cpp
constexpr bool ptr_compare()
{
  int* p = new int[2]{};
  bool b = &p[0] < &p[1];
  delete [] p;
  return b;
}

static_assert(ptr_compare());
```

It is therefore unsurprising that we include the `std::shared_ptr` relational
operators within the scope of our proposal to apply `constexpr`{.cpp} to all
functions within [smartptr]{.sref}; the `std::shared_ptr` aliasing
constructor makes this especially simple to configure:

```cpp
constexpr bool sptr_compare()
{
  double *arr = new double[2];
  std::shared_ptr p{&arr[0]}, q{p, p.get() + 1};
  return p < q;
}

static_assert(sptr_compare());
```

Furthermore, in the interests of `constexpr`{.cpp} consistency, we propose that
the relational operators of `std::unique_ptr` also now include support for
constant evaluation. As discussed above, the results of such comparisons are
very often well defined.

It may be argued that a `std::unique_ptr` which is the sole owner of an array,
or an object with data members, presents less need for relational operators.
Yet we must consider that a custom deleter can easily change the operational
semantics; as demonstrated in the example below. A `std::unique_ptr` should
also be legally comparable with itself.

```cpp
constexpr bool uptr_compare()
{
  short* p = new short[2]{};
  auto del = [](short*){};
  std::unique_ptr<short[]>               a{p+0};
  std::unique_ptr<short[],decltype(del)> b{p+1, del};
  return a < b;
}

static_assert(uptr_compare());
```

## Maybe Not Now, But Soon

A core message of C++23's [@P2448R2] is that the C++ community is served better
by including the language version alongside the tuple of possible inputs
(i.e. function and template arguments) considered for a `constexpr`{.cpp}
function invocation within a constant expression. Consequently, while there are
some functions in [smartptr]{.sref} which cannot possibly be so evaluated
*today*, we propose that these should also be specified with the
`constexpr`{.cpp} keyword. The following lists all such functions or
classes:

  * [util.smartptr.weak.bad]{.sref}: `std::bad_weak_ptr`{.cpp} cannot be constructed as it inherits from a class, `std::exception`, which has no `constexpr` member functions.
  * [util.smartptr.hash]{.sref}: The `operator()` member of the class template specialisations for `std::hash<std::unique_ptr<T,D>>` and `std::hash<std::shared_ptr<T>>` cannot be defined according to the *Cpp17Hash* requirements ([hash.requirements]{.sref}). (A pointer cannot, during constant evaluation, be converted to an `std::size_t` using `reinterpret_cast`{.cpp}; or otherwise.)
  * [util.smartptr.owner.hash]{.sref}: The two `operator()` member functions of the recently adopted `owner_hash` class, also cannot be defined according to the *Cpp17Hash* requirements.
  * [util.smartptr.shared.obs]{.sref}: The recently adopted `owner_hash()` member function of `std::shared_ptr`, also cannot be defined according to the *Cpp17Hash* requirements.

# Impact on the Standard

This proposal is a pure library extension, and does not require any new language features.

# Implementation

An implementation based on the GNU C++ Library (libstdc++) can be found
[here](https://github.com/SCT4SP/constexpr_shared_ptr). A comprehensive test
suite is included there within `tests/shared_ptr_constexpr_tests.cpp`;
alongside a standalone bash script to run it. All tests pass with recent GCC
and Clang (i.e. versions supporting P2738; `__cpp_constexpr >= 202306L`).
