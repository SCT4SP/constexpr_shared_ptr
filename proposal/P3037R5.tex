\section{Introduction}

Since the adoption of \cite{P0784R7} in C++20, constant expressions can include
dynamic memory allocation; yet support for smart pointers extends only to
\texttt{std::unique\_ptr} (since \cite{P2273R3} in C++23). As at runtime, smart
pointers can encourage hygienic memory management during constant evaluation;
and with no remaining technical obstacles, parity between runtime and
compile-time support for smart pointers should reflect the increased maturity
of language support for constant expression evaluation.  We therefore propose
that \texttt{std::shared\_ptr} and appropriate class template member functions
from \wgxxi{smartptr} permit \texttt{constexpr} evaluation.

\section{Motivation and Scope}

It is convenient when the same C++ code can be deployed both at runtime and
compile time. Our recent project investigates performance scaling of
\emph{parallel} constant expression evaluation in an experimental Clang
compiler \cite{ClangOz}. As well as C++17 parallel algorithms, a prototype
\texttt{constexpr} implementation of the Khronos SYCL API was utilised, where a
SYCL \texttt{buffer} class abstracts over device and/or host memory. In the
simplified code excerpt below, the \texttt{std::shared\_ptr} data member
ensures memory is properly deallocated upon the \texttt{buffer}'s destruction,
according to its owner status. This is a common approach for runtime code, and
a \texttt{constexpr std::shared\_ptr} class implementation helpfully bypasses
thoughts of raw pointers and preprocessor macros. The impact of adding
\texttt{constexpr} functionality to the SYCL implementation is therefore
minimised.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]
template <class T, int dims = 1>
struct buffer
{
  constexpr buffer(const range<dims> &r)
    : range_{ r }, data_{ new T[r.size()], [this](auto* p){ delete [] p; } } { }

  constexpr buffer(T* hostData, const range<dims>& r)
    : range_{ r }, data_{ hostData, [](auto){} } { }

  const range<dims> range_{};
  std::shared_ptr<T[]> data_{};
};
\end{lstlisting}

Adopted C++26 proposal \cite{P2738R1} facilitates a straightforward
implementation of comprehensive \texttt{constexpr} support for
\texttt{std::shared\_ptr}, allowing the \texttt{get\_deleter} member function
to operate, given the type erasure required within the
\texttt{std::shared\_ptr} unary class template. We furthermore propose that the
relational operators of \texttt{std::unique\_ptr}, which can legally operate on
pointers originating from a single allocation during constant evaluation,
should also adopt the \texttt{constexpr} specifier.

As with C++23 \texttt{constexpr} support for \texttt{std::unique\_ptr}, bumping
the value \texttt{\_\_cpp\_lib\_constexpr\_memory} is our requested feature
macro change; yet in the discussion and implementation presented here, we adopt
the macro \texttt{\_\_cpp\_lib\_constexpr\_shared\_ptr}.

We below elaborate on points which go beyond the simple addition of the
\texttt{constexpr} specifier to the relevant member functions.

\subsection{Atomic Operations}

The existing \texttt{std::shared\_ptr} class can operate within a multithreaded
runtime environment. A number of its member functions may therefore be defined
using atomic functions; so ensuring that shared state is updated correctly.
Atomic functions are not qualified as \texttt{constexpr}; but as constant
expressions must be evaluated by a single thread, a \texttt{constexpr}
\texttt{std::shared\_ptr} implementation can safely skip calls to atomic
functions through the predication of \texttt{std::is\_constant\_evaluated} (or
\texttt{if consteval}). For example, here is a modified function from GCC's
libstdc++, called from \texttt{std::shared\_ptr::use\_count()} and elsewhere:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]
constexpr long
_M_get_use_count() const noexcept
{
#ifdef __cpp_lib_constexpr_shared_ptr
  return std::is_constant_evaluated()
           ? _M_use_count
           : __atomic_load_n(&_M_use_count, __ATOMIC_RELAXED);
#else
  return __atomic_load_n(&_M_use_count, __ATOMIC_RELAXED);
#endif
}
\end{lstlisting}

The use of atomic intrinsics within Clang's libc++ and MSVC's STL can be elided
similarly. In \texttt{\_\_memory/shared\_ptr.h}, libc++ makes calls to the
atomic intrinsic \texttt{\_\_atomic\_load\_n}, only via the inline C++
functions \texttt{\_\_libcpp\_relaxed\_load} and
\texttt{\_\_libcpp\_acquire\_load}; while \texttt{\_\_atomic\_add\_fetch} is
accessed only via \texttt{\_\_libcpp\_atomic\_refcount\_increment} and
\texttt{\_\_libcpp\_atomic\_refcount\_decrement}. Each of these four functions
is comprised only of return statement pairs, predicated upon \emph{object-like}
macros including \texttt{\_LIBCPP\_HAS\_NO\_THREADS}; and so could easily be
modified to involve \texttt{std::is\_constant\_evaluated} as above.

In \texttt{stl/inc/memory}, the \texttt{std::shared\_ptr} of MSVC's STL
inherits a \texttt{\_Ref\_count\_base} member through \texttt{\_Ptr\_base}.
\texttt{\_Ref\_count\_base} has two \texttt{\_Atomic\_counter\_t} members
(aliases of \texttt{unsigned long}), updated atomically using the
\texttt{\_InterlockedCompareExchange}; \texttt{\_InterlockedIncrement} (via the
macro \texttt{\_MT\_INCR}); or \texttt{\_InterlockedDecrement} (via the macro
\texttt{\_MT\_DECR}) atomic intrinsics. All the (five) functions invoking these
intrinsics can again make use of \texttt{std::is\_constant\_evaluated} to avoid
the atomic operations.

Adding \texttt{constexpr} support to an implementation of
\texttt{std::shared\_ptr} utilising \texttt{std::atomic} would need to take an
alternative approach; likely involving the modification of its
\texttt{std::atomic} definition. Recently, \cite{P3309R3} has proposed adding
such \texttt{constexpr} functionality to \texttt{std::atomic} (and
\texttt{std::atomic\_ref}) for C++26.

\subsection{Two Memory Allocations}

Unlike \texttt{std::unique\_ptr}, a \texttt{std::shared\_ptr} must store not
only the managed object, but also the type-erased deleter and allocator, as
well as the number of \texttt{std::shared\_ptr}s and \texttt{std::weak\_ptr}s
which own or refer to the managed object. This information is managed as part
of a dynamically allocated object referred to as the \emph{control block}.

Existing runtime implementations of \texttt{std::make\_shared},
\texttt{std::allocate\_shared}, \texttt{std::make\_shared\_for\_overwrite}, and
\texttt{std::allocate\_shared\_for\_overwrite}, allocate memory for both the
control block, \emph{and} the managed object, from a single dynamic memory
allocation; via \texttt{reinterpret\_cast}.  This practise aligns with a remark
at \wgxxi{util.smartptr.shared.create}; quoted below:

\makebox[0pt][r]{(7.1)\quad} - Implementations should perform no more than one memory allocation.\newline
\makebox[0pt][r]{\quad} \phantom{-} [\emph{Note 1}: This provides efficiency equivalent to an intrusive smart pointer.  - \emph{end note}]

As \texttt{reinterpret\_cast} is not permitted within a constant expression, an
alternative approach is required for \texttt{std::make\_shared},
\texttt{std::allocate\_shared}, \texttt{std::make\_shared\_for\_overwrite}, and
\texttt{std::allocate\_shared\_for\_overwrite}.  A straightforward solution is
to create the object first, and pass its address to the appropriate
\texttt{std::shared\_ptr} constructor. Considering the control block, this
approach amounts to two dynamic memory allocations; albeit at compile-time.
Assuming that the runtime implementation need not change, the remark quoted
above can be left unchanged; as this is only a recommendation, not a
requirement.

\subsection{Relational Operators}

Comparing dynamically allocated pointers within a constant expression is legal,
provided the result of the comparison is not unspecified.  Such comparisons are
defined in terms of a partial order, applicable to pointers which either point
\emph{``to different elements of the same array, or to subobjects
thereof...''}; or to \emph{``different non-static data members of the same
object, or to subobjects of such members, recursively...''}; from paragraph 4
of \wgxxi{expr.rel}. A simple example program is shown below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]
constexpr bool ptr_compare()
{
  int* p = new int[2]{};
  bool b = &p[0] < &p[1];
  delete [] p;
  return b;
}

static_assert(ptr_compare());
\end{lstlisting}

It is therefore unsurprising that we include the \texttt{std::shared\_ptr}
relational operators within the scope of our proposal to apply
\texttt{constexpr} to all functions within \wgxxi{smartptr}; the
\texttt{std::shared\_ptr} aliasing constructor makes this especially simple to
configure:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]
constexpr bool sptr_compare()
{
  double *arr = new double[2];
  std::shared_ptr p{&arr[0]}, q{p, p.get() + 1};
  return p < q;
}

static_assert(sptr_compare());
\end{lstlisting}

Furthermore, in the interests of \texttt{constexpr} consistency, we propose
that the relational operators of \texttt{std::unique\_ptr} \emph{also} now
include support for constant evaluation. As discussed above, the results of
such comparisons are very often well defined.

It may be argued that a \texttt{std::unique\_ptr} which is the sole owner of an
array, or an object with data members, presents less need for relational
operators. Yet we must consider that a custom deleter can easily change the
operational semantics; as demonstrated in the example below. A
\texttt{std::unique\_ptr} should also be legally comparable with itself.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=cpp]
constexpr bool uptr_compare()
{
  short* p = new short[2]{};
  auto del = [](short*){};
  std::unique_ptr<short[]>               a{p+0};
  std::unique_ptr<short[],decltype(del)> b{p+1, del};
  return a < b;
}

static_assert(uptr_compare());
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Maybe Not Now, But Soon}
\label{sec:mnnbs}

The functions from \wgxxi{smartptr} listed below cannot possibly be evaluated
within a constant expression. We \emph{do not} propose that their
specifications should change. While C++23's \cite{P2448R2} allows such
functions to be annotated as \texttt{constexpr}, we suggest that in this
instance the C++ community will be served better by a future update; when their
constant evaluation becomes possible.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \wgxxi{util.smartptr.hash}: The \texttt{operator()} member of the class template specialisations for \texttt{std::hash<std::unique\_ptr<T,D>>} and \texttt{std::hash<std::shared\_ptr<T>>} cannot be defined according to the \emph{Cpp17Hash} requirements (\wgxxi{hash.requirements}). (A pointer cannot, during constant evaluation, be converted to an \texttt{std::size\_t} using \texttt{reinterpret\_cast}; or otherwise.)

  \item \wgxxi{util.smartptr.owner.hash}: The two \texttt{operator()} member functions of the recently adopted \texttt{owner\_hash} class, also cannot be defined according to the \emph{Cpp17Hash} requirements.

  \item \wgxxi{util.smartptr.shared.obs}: The recently adopted \texttt{owner\_hash()} member function of \texttt{std::shared\_ptr}, also cannot be defined according to the \emph{Cpp17Hash} requirements.

  \item \wgxxi{util.smartptr.weak.obs}: The recently adopted \texttt{owner\_hash()} member function of \texttt{std::weak\_ptr}, also cannot be defined according to the \emph{Cpp17Hash} requirements.

  \item \wgxxi{util.smartptr.shared.cast}: Neither of the two \texttt{reinterpret\_pointer\_cast} overloads can be included as their implementations will typically call \texttt{reinterpret\_cast}, which is prohibited here.

\end{itemize}

We also \emph{do not} propose any specification change for the overloads of
\texttt{operator<<} for \texttt{std::shared\_ptr} and
\texttt{std::unique\_ptr}, from \wgxxi{util.smartptr.shared.io} and
\wgxxi{unique.ptr.io}. Unlike the functions above, a \texttt{constexpr}
implementation for the overloads could today use a vendor-specific extension;
do nothing; or simply report an error. But such possibilities should be
discussed in a separate proposal focused on I/O.

\section{Impact on the Standard}

This proposal is a pure library extension, and does not require any new
language features.

\section{Implementation}

An implementation based on the GNU C++ Library (libstdc++) can be found
\href{https://github.com/SCT4SP/constexpr_shared_ptr}{here}. A comprehensive
test suite is included there within
\texttt{tests/shared\_ptr\_constexpr\_tests.cpp}; alongside a standalone bash
script to run it. All tests pass with recent GCC and Clang (i.e. versions
supporting \cite{P2738R1}; \texttt{\_\_cpp\_constexpr >= 202306L}).

A second implementation, by Hana Dusíková, based on the ``libc++'' C++ Library
is also available: on Github
\href{https://github.com/hanickadot/llvm-project/tree/P3309-constexpr-atomic-and-atomic-ref}{here}
(via commit 23217d0); and with a corresponding Compiler Explorer instance
\href{https://compiler-explorer.com/z/8cj7nc1no}{here}.
